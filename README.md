# Algorithm-Performance-per-User
This project aims to evaluate the performance of different recommendation algorithms at an user level across multiple datasets. By calculating the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) for each user across all algorithm-dataset pair, the project investigate whether selecting algorithm based on user can enhance recommendation quality and user satisfaction. RecPack library was used for calculating per-user NDCG values.
